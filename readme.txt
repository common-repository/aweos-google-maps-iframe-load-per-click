== Description ==

### Automatic Google Maps iFrame Blocker
 
You would like to use embedded Google Maps on your website, but you have to comply with the guidelines of the GDPR/DSGVO? Maybe you want to speed up your site and let the visitor load the map if it's really necessary? This plugin automatically blocks embedded Google Maps for you.
 
Instead of a map, we'll load a placeholder image to indicate that there is a map where users can interact with. To make this even more clear, we let you configure a text displayed to the visitor.

It's important to block the communication between your visitors and the Google server for several reasons.
* **Performance and loading time:** There are tons of reasons why iFrames are bad for the performance of your site, blocking them on page load should help your site to load faster.
* **Privacy and data protection:** You can get into legal problems if the visitor has not given you his explicit consent to forward his data to any third party service (like Google).

These are the main reasons we developed this plugin, it solves these problems by finding Google maps completely automatically on your site and replacing them with our temporary placeholder that can be activated by the visitor.

##### Automatically Swap Google Maps with an Image Placeholder

* Fully customizable CSS classes for the map placeholder.
* No setup required, no changes on your Google maps and no extra work for you.
* No branding necessary, no links to other websites.

##### Are your visitors protected?

* Informed the user that a connection to Google is being established.
* Google Maps can be blocked by the visitor. This can prevent communication with a Google server.
